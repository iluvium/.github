## 🕂 The Iluvium Manifesto

> **Iluvium** is not a framework.
> It’s a pact between the developer and the code.
>
> It refuses magic — but it embraces elegance.
> It rejects rigidity — but it honors structure.
>
> You don’t code *inside* Iluvium.
> You code *with* it.
>
> Every component is replaceable.
> Every dependency is reversible.
> Every abstraction is explicit.
>
> Iluvium doesn’t dictate.
> It assists.
>
> It’s the space where **DDD**, **TDD**, and **BDD** breathe the same air.
> A return to clarity —
> A rebellion against black boxes —
> A craft reborn.

## 🧩 Philosophy

Iluvium exists to **restore justice to PHP craft**.
It’s a framework built not to control your architecture,
but to **protect your intentions**.

Where others hide complexity behind helpers and conventions,
Iluvium chooses transparency and sovereignty.
You should never have to “fight” the framework to practice Clean Architecture, DDD, or TDD.

Laravel simplified too much.
Symfony formalized too hard.
Iluvium stands between —
where **clarity meets elegance**,
and **power never costs understanding**.

## ⚙️ Core Principles

### 1. Explicit by Design

> No hidden helpers, no silent defaults.
> Every behavior is traceable and testable.

### 2. Replaceable by Nature

> You can swap the Router, Cache, EventBus, IoC, or ORM.
> No vendor lock-in, no hard dependency.

### 3. Immutable and Composable

> State should never surprise you.
> Every data structure and operation is deterministic.

### 4. Crafted for Humans

> Developer Experience without black magic.
> Readable, minimal, fluent — but never obscure.

### 5. Sovereign by Philosophy

> The framework assists your solution.
> It never defines it.

## 🧬 The Iluvium Ecosystem

### 🌄 Arda — ORM and Persistence Layer

A domain-driven ORM designed around **truth**, not convenience.
Type-safe entities, clear transactions, no hidden behavior.

### 🍃 Verrastra — BDD Test Framework

A test runner built for **intent**, not assertion.
Readable specifications, attribute-based discovery, zero closures by default.

### 🌁 Iluvium\Data — The Core of Clarity

Where data becomes **expressive**.

* **`List<T>`**, **`Map<K, V>`**, **`Set<T>`**, **`Optional<T>`** —
  immutable, typified structures using PHPDoc generics (`@template`).
* **`Stream<T>`** — lazy, composable data pipelines inspired by Java/.NET.
  Filter, map, reduce with clean lambdas, without performance loss.
* Designed for **readability**, **predictability**, and **sovereignty**.

> In Iluvium, types are not declarations — they are **statements of intent**.
> You don’t write `List<User>`.
> You write `UserList`.
> Because clarity beats cleverness.

## 🔭 The Promise

Iluvium isn’t built to replace Laravel or Symfony.
It’s built to remind PHP what it could have been:

> **A language of craftsmanship, not convenience.**

A place where a developer can think, design, and test
without ever wondering what the framework is doing behind their back.

No conventions over configuration.
No magic over clarity.
No shortcuts over mastery.

Just **code, intention, and justice.**

> You won’t feel like coding in Iluvium.
> You’ll feel like **finally practicing the art PHP was meant for.**
